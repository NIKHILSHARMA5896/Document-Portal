They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs,Llama 2and\\nLlama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\\nLlama 2-Chatmodels generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data\\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving\\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development ofLlama 2andLlama 2-Chat, such as\\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\\n3'),\n",

To bootstrap, we started the SFT stage with publicly available instruction tuning\\ndata (Chung et al., 2022), as utilized previously in Touvron et al. (2023).\\nQuality Is All You Need.Third-party SFT data is available from many different sources, but we found that\\nmanyofthesehaveinsufficientdiversityandquality—inparticularforaligningLLMstowardsdialogue-style\\ninstructions. As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data,\\nas illustrated in Table 5. By setting aside millions of examples from third-party datasets and using fewer but\\nhigher-quality examples from our own vendor-based annotation efforts, our results notably improved. These\\nfindingsaresimilarinspirittoZhouetal.(2023),whichalsofindsthatalimitedsetofcleaninstruction-tuning\\ndata can be sufficient to reach a high level of quality. We found that SFT annotations in the order of tens of\\nthousands was enough to achieve a high-quality result. We stopped annotating SFT after collecting a total of\\n27,540 annotations. Note that we do not include any Meta user data.\\nWe also observed that different annotation platforms and vendors can result in markedly different down-\\nstream model performance, highlighting the importance of data checks even when using vendors to source\\nannotations. Tovalidateourdataquality,wecarefullyexaminedasetof180examples,comparingtheannota-\\ntions provided by humans with the samples generated by the model through manual scrutiny. Surprisingly,\\nwe found that the outputs sampled from the resulting SFT model were often competitive with SFT data\\nhandwritten by human annotators, suggesting that we could reprioritize and devote more annotation effort\\nto preference-based annotation for RLHF.\\nFine-Tuning Details. For supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial\\nlearning rate of2 × 10−5, a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 64, and a sequence length of 4096 tokens.\\nFor the fine-tuning process, each sample consists of a prompt and an answer. To ensure the model sequence\\nlength is properly filled, we concatenate all the prompts and answers from the training set. A special token is\\nutilized to separate the prompt and answer segments. We utilize an autoregressive objective and zero-out\\nthe loss on tokens from the user prompt, so as a result, we backpropagate only on answer tokens. Finally, we\\nfine-tune the model for 2 epochs.\\n3.2 Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)\\nRLHF is a model training procedure that is applied to a fine-tuned language model to furtheralignmodel\\nbehavior with human preferences and instruction following.

We chose a binary comparison protocol over\\nother schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts. Still, other\\nstrategies are worth considering, which we leave for future work.\\nOur annotation procedure proceeds as follows. We ask annotators to first write a prompt, then choose\\nbetween two sampled model responses, based on provided criteria. In order to maximize the diversity, the\\ntworesponsestoagivenpromptaresampledfromtwodifferentmodelvariants,andvaryingthetemperature\\nhyper-parameter. Inadditiontogivingparticipantsaforcedchoice,wealsoaskannotatorstolabelthedegree\\nto which they prefer their chosen response over the alternative: either their choice issignificantly better, better,\\nslightly better, ornegligibly better/ unsure.\\nFor our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how\\nwell Llama 2-Chatresponses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to\\nwhether Llama 2-Chat’s responses are unsafe, e.g.,“giving detailed instructions on making a bomb”could\\nbe considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to\\napply specific guidelines to each and better guide annotators; for example, our safety annotations provide\\ninstructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.\\nApart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage.\\nThis additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response\\nis safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with\\n18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples\\nwhere the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be\\nbetter/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations\\ncan be found in Section 4.2.1.\\nHuman annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our\\nreward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions forLlama 2-Chat(see\\nthe results in Section 5, Figure 20).Llama 2-Chatimprovement also shifted the model’s data distribution.\\nSince reward model accuracy can quickly degrade if not exposed to this new sample distribution, i.e., from\\nhyper-specialization (Scialom et al., 2020b), it is important before a newLlama 2-Chattuning iteration to\\ngather new preference data using the latestLlama 2-Chatiterations. This step helps keep the reward model\\non-distribution and maintain an accurate reward for the latest model.\\nIn Table 6, we report the statistics of reward modeling data that we collected over time, and present them\\nagainst multiple open-source preference datasets including Anthropic Helpful and Harmless (Bai et al.,\\n2022a), OpenAI Summarize (Stiennon et al., 2020), OpenAI WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021), StackExchange\\n(Lambert et al., 2023), Stanford Human Preferences (Ethayarajh et al., 2022), and Synthetic GPT-J (Havrilla).\\nWe collected a large dataset of over 1 million binary comparisons based on humans applying our specified\\nguidelines, which we refer to asMetareward modeling data. Note that the number of tokens in prompts and\\nanswers differs depending on the text domain. Summarization and online forum data generally have longer\\nprompts, while dialogue-style prompts are usually shorter. Compared to existing open-source datasets, our\\npreference data features more conversation turns, and are longer, on average.\\n3.2.2 Reward Modeling\\nThe reward model takes a model response and its corresponding prompt (including contexts from previous\\nturns) as inputs and outputs a scalar score to indicate the quality (e.g., helpfulness and safety) of the model\\ngeneration. Leveraging such response scores as rewards, we can optimizeLlama 2-Chatduring RLHF for\\nbetter human preference alignment and improved helpfulness and safety.\\nOthers have found that helpfulness and safety sometimes trade off (Bai et al., 2022a), which can make it\\nchallenging for a single reward model to perform well on both. To address this, we train two separate reward\\nmodels, one optimized for helpfulness (referred to asHelpfulness RM) and another for safety (Safety RM).\\nWe initialize our reward models from pretrained chat model checkpoints, as it ensures that both models\\nbenefit from knowledge acquired in pretraining. In short, the reward model “knows” what the chat model\\n10')]"

       "\"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question based on the provided context. The question is asking for a summary of the paper. Let me read through the context carefully.\\n\\nThe context starts with a citation by Thomas Scialom and others about a paper on abstractive summarization using discriminative adversarial search. Then there's a paragraph mentioning that the paper contributes a thorough description of their fine-tuning methodology for improving LLM safety. They hope this openness will help the community reproduce and improve these models, leading to more responsible development. They also share new observations from developing Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, like tool usage and knowledge organization.\\n\\nThen there are more citations from other authors, but those seem unrelated to the main paper in question. The last part lists acknowledgments, which probably aren't part of the main content.\\n\\nSo, the main paper discussed in the context is about their approach to fine-tuning LLMs for safety, their methodology, and some new findings. The other citations are just references and don't contribute to the paper's summary.\\n\\nI think the answer should focus on the main paper's contributions: their methodology for improving LLM safety, the openness for reproducibility, and the novel observations from Llama 2 developments.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe paper by Thomas Scialom and colleagues presents a detailed methodology for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to enhance safety. They emphasize openness and reproducibility, encouraging the community to build upon their work for responsible LLM development. Additionally, the paper highlights novel insights gained during the development of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, particularly the emergence of tool usage and the temporal organization of knowledge, showcasing advancements in model capabilities.\""
